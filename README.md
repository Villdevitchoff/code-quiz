Tutor Team Coverage
Tutors will set their schedules according to their own availability. If they are taking time off for holidays, they will inform their students and block the time off of their calendars. However, many tutors leave their calendars open on holidays. Make-up sessions for students are offered if the tutor is unavailable/off for the holiday break.
I will be returning on January 3, 2022, and will respond to any messages on that date in the order in which they were received. If you need any assistance during the holiday break, feel free to contact support@bootcampspot.com. Please note that there may be some delays in response rates due to limited holiday staff coverage. Please note- CHALLENGE 4's due date is 12/26. If you would like to turn the assignment in later, please do! I will be checking over assignments submission when I return to the office on January 3rd. 
As always, please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!
